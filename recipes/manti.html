    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Manti is a famous meal from my country. To prepare this dish takes time, but I'm sure you'll agree it's worth it!
        Enjoy-afiyet olsun (bon appetit)!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more
            water, if
            needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shred the onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain the juice and discard. Combine
            the onion,
            ground beef, salt, and pepper; mix the meat well with a spoon until mashed.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two portions and lightly flour a work surface. Keep one piece of dough covered while
            you roll out
            the second portion into a rectangle, rolling the dough as thin as you can. Cut the rectangle into 2-inch
            squares with a
            knife or pastry wheel.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 teaspoons of the meat filling in the center of each square. Seal the dumplings by gathering
            the edges of
            the dough and pinching them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer the finished manti to a floured
            plate, and
            sprinkle more flour over the manti to prevent sticking. Repeat with the second piece of dough.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until the pepper flakes have
            started to color
            the oil; don't let them burn. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Stir the minced garlic into the yogurt and
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook the manti until the filling is
            no longer
            pink, and the dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well. Divide the manti among four plates. Spoon the
            yogurt sauce
            over the manti and drizzle each serving with the hot pepper oil.</li>
    </ol>
